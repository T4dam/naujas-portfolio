               I dedicated my time and curiosity to become front-end web developer and to 
               pursue the ever changing environment of the world wide web with this thought
               in mind. With the help of CodeAcademy and online courses I have
               gained experience in such technologies
               as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Material-ui, Bootstrap, Redux, Node.js and more.<br />
               <br />
               Aside from growing as a developer, on my free time I enjoy playing chess, video games and working out.<br /><br />

I'm a life long learner and try to show my best performance towards specific tasks.
 Throughout my prior journeys and jobs I also gained experience in 
 communication and teamwork.</p>
