                   I dedicated my time and curiosity to become front-end web developer and to
                   pursue the ever changing environment of the world wide web with this thought
                   in mind. With the help of CodeAcademy and online courses I have
                   gained experience in such technologies
                   as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Material-ui, Bootstrap, Redux, Node.js, Next.js, Tailwindcss and more.<br />
                   <br />
                   Aside from growing as a developer, on my free time I enjoy playing chess, video games and working out.<br /><br />
                
                I{`'`}m a life long learner and try to show my best performance towards specific tasks.
                 Throughout my prior journeys and jobs I also gained experience in 
                 communication and teamwork.</p>
